# What is Rubber Ducky?
USB Rubber ducky is an HID device that looks similar to a USB Pen drive. It is a macro keyboard device that automates keystrokes that can type up to 1000 words per minute! Anything that can be done on a keyboard can be done with the Ducky. It may be used to inject keystroke into a system, used to hack a system, steal victims essential and credential data can inject payload to the victimâ€™s computers. The main important thing about USB Rubber ducky is that it cannot be detected by any Anti-Virus or Firewall as it acts as an HID device. But here we are using Arduino boards as USB rubber ducky .

# What is DIGISPARK?

The Digispark is an Attiny85 based microcontroller development board similar to the Arduino line, only cheaper, smaller, and a bit less powerful. With a whole host of shields to extend its functionality and the ability to use the familiar Arduino IDE the Digispark is a great way to jump into electronics, or perfect for when an Arduino is too big or too much.
